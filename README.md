## üìå Overview
This repository implements an end-to-end pipeline for fraud detection:
- Data loading & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Evaluation with key metrics (Precision/Recall/F1/AUC)
- Inference on new transactions

## üì¶ Data

This project uses a publicly available dataset from **Kaggle**.  

- **Dataset Name:** [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- **Description:** Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with features resulting from PCA transformation.  
- **Size:** 284,807 transactions with 492 fraud cases (highly imbalanced).  

üì• **Download Instructions:**  
1. Go to the [dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
2. Click **Download** (requires Kaggle account)  
3. Place the file (e.g., `creditcard.csv`) into the `data/` directory of this project.
