Designed and implemented a machine learning model to detect fraudulent banking transactions with high precision and
recall.
Preprocessed real-world financial datasets by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and performing
feature scaling to improve model performance.
Trained and evaluated multiple classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to
identify suspicious transactions, selecting the best-performing model based on accuracy, F1-score, and confusion
matrix.
Developed a prototype system that flags high-risk transactions in real time for potential human review.
